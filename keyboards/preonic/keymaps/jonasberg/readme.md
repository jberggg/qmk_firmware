# The (not so) default Preonic layout - largely based on the Planck's

Changes from the default preonic keyboard layout besides some key swaps:

* Umlaut on double tap of the corresponding key implemented with unicode to be operating system compatible
* Backslash on double tap of slash
* Capslock on double tap of left shift
* OS mode keys for switching between OSX and Linux settings
