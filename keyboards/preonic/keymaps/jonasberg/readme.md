# Jonas Berg's Preonic Layout

Variation of the Preonic default layout that works for languages that use umlaut e.g.
german or swiss german and at the same time is compatible with Linux and OSX.

This layout is "handling" wise compatible with my [Planck keyboard layout](../../../planck/keymaps/jonasberg/readme.md).

Changes from the default preonic keyboard layout besides some key swaps:

* Umlaut on double tap of the corresponding key - implemented with unicode to work on Linux and OSX
* Backslash on double tap of slash
* Capslock on double tap of left shift
* OS mode keys for switching between OSX and Linux settings

In Linux set the keyboard layout to `US` and select Linux mode by pressing `Lower` + `Upper` + `L`. 
In OSX set the keyboard to `Unicode Input` and select OSX mode by pressing `Lower` + `Upper` + `O`.
